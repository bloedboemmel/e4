## It hasn't updated for a long time...
This is a GitHub-Issue with cron. They are aware of it and so am I. 
If you can't wait, [press here!](https://github.com/bloedboemmel/e4/issues/new?title=E4%3AUpdate%20Yourself%21&body=Please+do+not+change+the+title.+Just+click+"Submit+new+issue".+You+don't+need+to+do+anything+else+%3AD)

## Is this really the correct data?
Yes, it is the same data, which is used on their own websites, but a little more info!

## Wait! The average graph is the same like the now graph?!
Yes, that's for the first weeks till my bot collects more and more average-data

## I'm missing a feature! Or I found a new e4-gym!
Feel free to fork it and try to add your feature/E4 yourself. Or [open an issue!](https://github.com/bloedboemmel/boulderado/issues/new)

## What is planned for the future?
Also i'm planning to train an AI to predict the visitor-numbers depending on weather, user-data, holidays, events, etc.
